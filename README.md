# React Native Web Boilerplate

A complete **React Native** boilerplate that runs on **iOS**, **Android**, and **Web**, bootstrapped with [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli) and configured for web using [React Native Web](https://necolas.github.io/react-native-web/) + [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

> **Note**: This is a **React Native CLI** project, not an Expo project. It provides full access to native code and modules while maintaining web compatibility.

> - This boilerplate was created following the excellent guide by [@insertish](https://gist.github.com/insertish): [React Native Web + Vite Setup Guide](https://gist.github.com/insertish/9cca9b6aa75a7cf34d050368d067ecf5)
> - Web integration made easy thanks to [`vite-plugin-react-native-web`](https://github.com/Bram-dc/vite-plugin-react-native-web) by [@Bram-dc](https://github.com/Bram-dc)

## üöÄ Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [Set Up Your Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) guide before proceeding.

> **Prerequisites**: This project requires the React Native CLI development environment, not Expo. Make sure you have Android Studio and/or Xcode properly configured for native development.

## Step 1: Start the Development Server

Choose the appropriate development server for your target platform:

### For Mobile Development (iOS/Android)

Start **Metro**, the JavaScript build tool for React Native:

```sh
# Using npm
npm start
```

### For Web Development

Start the **Vite** development server for web:

```sh
# Using npm
npm run web
```

The web server will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

## Step 2: Run Your Application

### üì± Android

With Metro running, open a new terminal and run:

```sh
# Using npm
npm run android
```

### üçé iOS

For iOS, remember to install CocoaPods dependencies (this only needs to be run on first clone or after updating native deps).

The first time you create a new project, run the Ruby bundler to install CocoaPods itself:

```sh
bundle install
```

Then, and every time you update your native dependencies, run:

```sh
bundle exec pod install
```

For more information, please visit [CocoaPods Getting Started guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).

```sh
# Using npm
npm run ios
```

### üåê Web

To run the web version of your application:

```sh
# Using npm
npm run web
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

### üèóÔ∏è Build for Production (Web)

To create a production build for web:

```sh
# Using npm
npm run build:web
```

To preview the production build:

```sh
# Using npm
npm run preview:web
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in the Android Emulator, iOS Simulator, your connected device, or in your web browser.

## Step 3: Modify your app

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's make changes!

Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and make some changes. When you save, your app will automatically update and reflect these changes ‚Äî¬†this is powered by [Fast Refresh](https://reactnative.dev/docs/fast-refresh).

When you want to forcefully reload, for example to reset the state of your app, you can perform a full reload:

- **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Dev Menu**, accessed via <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (Windows/Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ‚åò</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (macOS).
- **iOS**: Press <kbd>R</kbd> in iOS Simulator.

### Force Reload

When you want to forcefully reload, for example to reset the state of your app, you can perform a full reload:

- **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Dev Menu**, accessed via <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (Windows/Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ‚åò</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (macOS).
- **iOS**: Press <kbd>R</kbd> in iOS Simulator.
- **Web**: Use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> (Windows/Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ‚åò</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> (macOS) to reload in the browser, or use browser dev tools.

## üîß Troubleshooting

If you're having issues getting the above steps to work, see the [Troubleshooting](https://reactnative.dev/docs/troubleshooting) page.

### Common Web-specific Issues

- **Dependencies Error**: Make sure all dependencies are installed with `npm install`
- **Port Already in Use**: If port 5173 is occupied, Vite will automatically use the next available port
- **Component Compatibility**: Not all React Native components are supported on web. Check the [React Native Web compatibility guide](https://necolas.github.io/react-native-web/docs/compatibility/)
- **Build Issues**: Ensure TypeScript compilation passes before building for web
- **Native Module Issues**: Remember this is a React Native CLI project, not Expo. Native modules require proper linking and may need platform-specific configuration
